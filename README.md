# luascript
Logitech G Hub LUA script

This script was created in order to create a macro, basically I just wanted to have my mouse and keyboard do a certain thing in a much simpler and optimized way without having to rapidfire it myself (which was doable but just tedious lol)

To execute it just paste it on the script tab on G Hub and click on "Save & Run" but be sure to have your sw in English first otherwise it won't save it and properly execute it (or at least it my own native tongue it didn't)
